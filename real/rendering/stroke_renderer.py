Key Classes/Functions:

StrokeRenderer: A class that handles the rendering of strokes.
draw_stroke(amplitude, pitch, formants): Draws strokes on the canvas using audio characteristics.
set_color(pitch): Determines the color of the stroke based on pitch.
set_thickness(amplitude): Determines the thickness of the stroke based on amplitude.
set_position(formants): Determines the position of the stroke based on formants (F1, F2).
